### An instrumenting profiler written in C

This project uses `ptrace` to instrument a binary in memory then profile function calls. I'm using ARM specific instructions so this won't work unless you're running a newish Mac or some other ARM machine. 

This project is incomplete and the repo is a mess. Enjoy.
